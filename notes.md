- Need to do jelly baby text4
- need to wire up an api (either predicative, or google, or local npm thesaurus?

Maybe try making a useless mouse?

Make it type somewhere at random - words in wrong order?
(wait for word to finish?).

Need some sort of general functions for modifying the text 
(new text, cursor point / changes) => modified text, cursor point.

USE the open processing API from that predictive text thing.
